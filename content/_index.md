Backend engineer by day, side project collector by night.

## What I Build

At work:

- High-performance backend systems serving multiple production applications
- Python packages: prediction algorithms, scheduling simulations, estimation tools
- Full ownership of our tech stack: Pyramid, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, and ArgoCD

For fun:

- CLIs and TUIs that solve my own problems (then I use them everywhere)
- Open source contributions across Python, Rust, and Go projects
- Game development experiments
